Broadly, my research aims to fundamentally understand the dynamics of microbial systems by developing predictive theories that connect the molecular, cellular, and population scales. In part of my research, I focus on bacteria at the single-cell level, connecting molecular processes to cell properties, specifically size control, and investigating multigenerational cell size memory. In another part, I focus on the population dynamics of tumor microbiota. Ultimately, I am interested in how microscopic dynamics give rise to ecological observations.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pittsburgh, USA, advised by Dr. Andrew Mugler.
