Hi, I am Motasem!

 I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pittsburgh, USA, specializing in theoretical biophysics and advised by Dr. Andrew Mugler. My research mainly focuses on understanding the cell size regulation mechanisms that lead to a stable cell cycle. In my work, I utilize different tools from stochastic physics to build mechanistic models that can help us explain biological phenomena, as well as performing simulations and analyzing experimental data.
