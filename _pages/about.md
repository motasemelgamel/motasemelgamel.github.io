My research focuses on bacterial growth both on the single-cell level and population level. Specifically, the effects of noise on cell size regulation, taking into account the coupling between different cell cycle variables and molecular processes. Moreover, I am interested in understanding the population growth dynamics of tumor-inhibiting bacteria subject to harsh environmental conditions.

I utilize different techniques from stochastic physics as well as computational techniques and simulations. I also work closely with experimental data from collaborators and perform my own analysis of the data.

 I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pittsburgh, USA, advised by Dr. Andrew Mugler.
